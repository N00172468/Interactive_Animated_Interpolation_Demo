### Ex. 1 - Looped HSB
- A full-windowed canvas displaying the HSB Colour Model.

### Ex. 2 - Interactive Looped HSB
- Replaced the static canvas to follow the mouse curser.
- In result, interactivity changes the scale of the HSB Colour Model.

### Ex. 3 - Radial Fan (HSB Variant)
- A medium-canvas displaying the HSB Colour Model in a radial fan pattern.
- Uses `DEGREES` instead of `RADIANS`.
- 2 versions: Static (commented out) and interactive.

### Ex. 4 - Basic Translations
- A refresher on the basics of `translate()`, `push()` and `pop()`.

### Ex. 5 - Interactive Colour Tool
- An interactive canvas that demonstrates the HSB Colour Model.
- Includes a colour wheel with rotating hues, Hue Display, Saturation Display and Brightness Display.
- Interaction consist of moving the mouse cursor from left to right to demonstrate HSB.
- Designed in a simplistic manner for User Experience (UX).
- An exercise to test on what we have learned so far within this chapter (i.e. color-shape). 

### Ex. 6 - Colour Interpolation (Tweening)
- Experimenting with the P5.js function `lerpColor()` to display interpolation.
